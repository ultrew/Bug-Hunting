## üõ† Automated Enumeration Tools

Several tools can help save time during the enumeration process. **Note:** These tools may miss some privilege escalation vectors and should be used as a supplement rather than a replacement for manual enumeration. The target system‚Äôs environment will influence which tools can be run (e.g., Python-based tools require Python installed on the target).
